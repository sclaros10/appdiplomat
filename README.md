# Adoption App
 
 I've build this app back on a diplomat about mobile apps and development. Initially, is a prototype of an adoption app, and its first page is a list of dogs with a small descrition of each of them including pictures.
 
 The language used to build this prototype was Kotlin and the IDE was Android Studio.
